We're reaching the final stretch; this is the second-to-last volume of _Dragon Ball_.

I had a lot of fun. There was a lot of action and a lot of comedy too, especially during the fight between **Gotenks** and **Boo**.

Here, we might witness the most original move in the entire series so far: the **Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack**. I don’t know why, but this reminds me a lot of the origins of _Dragon Ball_, where the fights were a little less about action and more about fantastic and humorous situations.

So, let the final volume come!
